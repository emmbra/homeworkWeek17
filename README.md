# Fitness-Tracker

## Description
Created a fitness-tracker app that allows user to add exercises to a noSQL MongoDB database and track exercise with graphs and charts.

From the homepage a user can begin a new workout or continue their current workout. In either case the user will be asked to choose an exercise type: Resistance or Cardio. After selecting an exercise type, the user will then enter information about the excercise and add the exercise to the database for tracking purposes.

* Resistance Exercise Criteria:
  * Exercise Name
  * Weight (lbs)
  * Sets
  * Reps
  * Duration (minutes)

* Cardio Exercise Criteria:
  * Exercise Name
  * Distance (miles)
  * Duration (minutes)

After adding exercises to the database, the user can then view charts by clicking on the Fitness Tracker Dashboard in the navbar. To continue adding exercises, the user must click Fitness Tracker in the navbar.

## Technologies

* MongoDB database
* Express server
* node.js
